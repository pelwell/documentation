- **CODEC** - Short for Coder/Decoder. Hardware or software blocks that encode and/or decode video or audio data.
- **config.txt** - a file located on the boot partition of a Raspberry Pi's SD card, which is parsed at boot time in order to enable, disable and manage operating system features which cannot be changed after booting. See the [offical documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/README.md)
- **CSI** - Camera Serial Interface. A hardware interface for connecting cameras to SoC's 
- **DHCP** - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol, a network management protocol which dynamically assigns an IP address and other network configuration parameters to each device on a network

- **Device Tree (DT)** - A data structure for defining hardware. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_tree
- **Device Tree Source (DTS)** - A human readable source file to be compiled into a DTB
- **Device Tree Blob (DTB)** - A binary file containing a device tree, the result of compiling DTS files.
- **dt-blob.bin** - A binary file containing initial GPIO configuration read by the firmware at boot time. Despite the confusing name, this is _not_ Device Tree (although it is compiled by the Device Tree tools).
- **DVI** - Digital Visual Interface. A video interface for connecting a source device to a monitor or display. Electrically compatible with HDMI so a simple adapter can convert from one to the other (excluding audio which DVI does not support). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Visual_Interface
- **GPIO** - General Purpose Input/Output, the programmable pins on the Raspberry Pi
- **HDMI** - High definition Multimedia Interface, a standard for transmitting uncompressed video and compressed or uncompressed audio data from a source device to a display device. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI
- **HDCP** - An optional encryption mechanism used for HDMI or DVI transmission. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-bandwidth_Digital_Content_Protection
- **HVS** - Hardware Video Scaler. A hardware block in the VC4 GPU on all Raspberry Pi models used for manipulatinga and displaying bitmaps.
- **I<sup>2</sup>C** - Inter-Integrated Circuit (pronounced I-squared-C) an electrical protocol used for attaching lower-speed peripheral ICs to processors and microcontrollers in short-distance, intra-board communication. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2C
- **I<sup>2</sup>S** - An electrical serial bus interface standard used for connecting digital audio devices together. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C2%B2S
- **ISP** - Imaging System Pipeline. A set of hardware (and sometimes software) stages that process images from a camera in to a high quality result. The Raspberry Pi has an inbuilt hardware ISP that processes images captured from the camera attached to the CSI port.
- **LED** - Light-Emitting Diode, a semiconductor device that produces light from electricity
- **MSD** - Amoungst other things, a Mass Storage Device such as an SD card or hard disk drive.
- **NAND** - A NAND gate is a logic gate, specifically an inverted AND gate. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAND_gate. Can also refer to a type of flash memory that uses NAND logic.
- **OTP** - One Time Programmable. A type of memory that can only be programmed one, and retains the programmed data after power off. Can be used for serial numbers etc.
- **Overlay** - A boot-time or run-time patch to a Device Tree allowing a degree of configuration by the user. See https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/device-tree.md for more details, or run `dtoverlay -a` for a list of available overlays.
- **raspi-config** - A command line tool for configuring Raspbian's operating system features. See the [Official Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md)
- **raspivid, raspistill, raspiyuv, raspividyuv** - A set of applications to run the Raspberry Pi camera in various modes. See the [Official Documentation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/raspbian/applications/camera.md)
- **Raspberry Pi Configuration Tool (rcgui)** - A graphical equivalent of `raspi-config`
- **Raspberry Pi Desktop** - A version of the LXDE desktop environment, specifically trailored to the Raspberry Pi (Used to be called Pixel)
